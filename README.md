# EffectPlayer
A nice effect player for some digital DnD 🐉🎲

## Installing requirements
Simple run the following line of code to install all dependencies:

	make
	
`python-tk` is also needed!

## Running the application
To run the application just type the following command:

	make (run)

That's it! Be sure to put all your effects inside `./Input/Effects` and all your music files into `./Input/Music` and restart the application to refresh all lists.

Everything inside Music is looped, everything inside Effects is not.


## Binding keyboard macros

Select an entry and press CONTROL + Left click. A window will pop up and ask you to bind a key to that entry.
